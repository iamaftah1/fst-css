      Got it üëç You‚Äôre asking for about **1000 words about Hargeisa**, the
      **capital city of Somaliland**. I‚Äôll prepare a full, structured write-up
      that covers its history, geography, society, culture, economy, and role as
      the political and economic heart of Somaliland. --- # Hargeisa: The
      Capital of Somaliland ## Introduction Hargeisa is the capital and largest
      city of Somaliland, a self-declared republic in the Horn of Africa.
      Nestled in the northwestern part of the country, Hargeisa is more than
      just a political capital‚Äîit is the cultural, economic, and social
      heartbeat of Somaliland. With an estimated population of over **1.2
      million people**, the city has undergone a remarkable transformation over
      the past three decades. From the devastation it suffered during the Somali
      civil war in the late 1980s, Hargeisa has risen to become one of the most
      stable and rapidly growing urban centers in the region. --- ## Geography
      and Climate Hargeisa lies in a valley surrounded by the Golis mountain
      range, at an altitude of approximately 1,300 meters (4,265 feet) above sea
      level. This elevation gives it a **milder climate** compared to other
      parts of Somaliland. * **Temperature:** Summers are warm but not as harsh
      as coastal cities like Berbera, while winters can be relatively cool. *
      **Rainfall:** The city relies on seasonal rains (Gu‚Äô and Deyr), though
      droughts are common. Water scarcity is a constant issue, and most
      residents depend on boreholes, wells, and water trucks. * **Landscape:**
      Hargeisa is characterized by semi-arid vegetation, scattered acacia trees,
      and rocky hills, providing a striking but challenging environment for
      urban life. --- ## Historical Background ### Early History The Hargeisa
      region has been inhabited for centuries by Somali clans engaged in trade,
      herding, and small-scale farming. Its strategic location on caravan trade
      routes connecting the interior of the Horn of Africa to the coast made it
      an important commercial stop. ### Colonial Era Under British rule in the
      late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hargeisa grew as a small
      administrative town within the British Somaliland Protectorate. Compared
      to coastal cities like Berbera, it remained relatively underdeveloped but
      gradually became a center for governance. ### Post-independence and Union
      When Somaliland briefly gained independence in June 1960 and then united
      with Italian Somalia, Hargeisa retained significance but was overshadowed
      by Mogadishu, the capital of the Somali Republic. ### Civil War and
      Destruction In the late 1980s, Hargeisa became the epicenter of resistance
      against Siad Barre‚Äôs dictatorship. The Somali National Movement (SNM),
      largely supported in Somaliland, fought government forces. In retaliation,
      Barre‚Äôs regime bombed Hargeisa heavily in 1988, reducing large parts of
      the city to rubble. This tragic event is remembered as the **Hargeisa
      Holocaust**, where thousands were killed and hundreds of thousands
      displaced. ### Recovery and Rebirth After Somaliland declared independence
      in 1991, Hargeisa began a long process of rebuilding. Local communities,
      diaspora remittances, and grassroots initiatives played key roles in
      restoring infrastructure, institutions, and livelihoods. Today, the city
      symbolizes resilience and self-reliance. --- ## Governance and Political
      Role As the **capital city**, Hargeisa houses the main institutions of
      Somaliland‚Äôs government: * **
